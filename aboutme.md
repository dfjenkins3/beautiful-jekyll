I started my college career with a focus on Biology, but I took a [programming](http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs015/) course and was hooked.

After graduating from Brown University with a degree in Computational Biology in 2011 I worked in industry for a few years.

In 2014 I entered the Bioinformatics Program at Boston University.
